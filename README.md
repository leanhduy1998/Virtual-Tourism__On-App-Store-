# Virtual Tourist

The fourth Project for the Udacity iOS Developer Nanodegree.

It allows users to virtually travel around the world by dropping pins on a map and view random Flickr photos for that location.

## Getting Started

### Adding images by dropping pins

You can drop a pin on the map, download random images from the location and view them.
